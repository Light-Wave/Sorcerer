# Sorcerer
A differnet way to play Magiclysm.
Instead of reading books, gain spells and spell levels when you level up, in much the same way as Bombasticperks.
Each level, you can nearn a limited number of spells.
Your caster level is determined by your sorcerer level and is boosted by your intelligence.
You are not limited to what spells you can pick by classes.
You may pick a bloodline that alters how the class works. For example, the spelldancer gets increased caster level from their effective dodge, rather than from intelligence.
