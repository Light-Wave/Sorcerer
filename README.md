# Sorcerer
A differnet way to play Magiclysm.
Instead of reading books, gain spells and spell levels when you level up, in the same way (and at the same rate) as Bombasticperks.
Each level, you can nearn a limited number of spells.
Your caster level is determined by your sorcerer level and is boosted by your intelligence.
You are not limited to what spells you can pick by classes.
