# Sorcerer
A differnet way to play Magiclysm.
Instead of reading books, gain spells and spell levels when you level up, in much the same way as Bombasticperks.
Each level, you can nearn a limited number of spells.
Your caster level is determined by your sorcerer level and is boosted by your intelligence; (int/2)-3, so +0 at 6, +1 at 8, +2 at 10, and so on.
You are not limited to what spells you can pick by classes.
You may pick a bloodline that alters how the class works. For example, the spelldancer gets increased caster level from their effective dodge, rather than from intelligence.

generated_code/spell_data_dump.txt contains data for all spells found and generated. You can copy that data into tools/spell_data-txt to edit properties of spells, disable spells, register sorcerer-specific spells, or manually alter the spell level of the spell.
